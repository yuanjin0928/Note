Elements of the Zynq-7000 AP (All Programmable) SoC are described from the point of view of the PS. For example, a  general purpose slave interface on the PS to the PL means that the master resides in the PL. A high  performance slave interface means the high performance master resides in the PL. A general purpose  master interface means the PS is the master and the slave resides in the PL. (<u>specify direction base</u>)

# Supported I/O standards and Terminations

The following sections provide an overview of the I/O standards and options supported by all <u>7 series devices.</u>

### LVTTL (Low Voltage TTL)

LVTTL is a general-purpose EIA/JESD standard for 3.3V applications that uses a single-ended CMOS input buffer and a push-pull output buffer. This standard requires a 3.3V output source voltage (V<sub>CCO</sub>), but does not require the use of a reference voltage (V<sub>REF</sub>>) or a termination voltage (V<sub>TT</sub>).
